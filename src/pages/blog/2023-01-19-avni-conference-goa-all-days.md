Everybody says Goa plans always fail but my team is different. We had planned our workation in Goa and successfully executed it. It was held between 12th jan to 16th jan.

I started my journey on the 11th night, and reached Goa the next day at 2pm. The journey was so hectic but excitement was high to meet my team after 6 months, and there were some team members who I’m going to see for the first time.

Mahalakshmi and Nupoor arrived one day before us .They were posting pictures of the resort and I was seeing those pictures and planning how we would enjoy our workcation

## First day

Everybody was tired but enthusiastic. We discussed and planned for our next 4 days, we planned for the work and the fun as well.

----------------------------

After work we took a short walk along the beach to calm our heads, White sand beach of Goa was the perfect place for this walk.

## Second day

Day 2 was a dream come true moment for me . Seeing and working with very people who I see only through skype/zoom. We went through the implementation walkthrough, different discussions ,feedback and lastly a lot of gossip.

Viewing a sunset along with colleagues was a mandatory activity for us. We also welcomed `JOY` newest member who will join Avni next month.

## Third Day
Maha was planning to do a retrospective meeting for the last 2 weeks.

The retrospective covered how we had been working as a team for the past few months, things that are going well and things that need improvement. A bunch of action items were discovered that we vowed to implement once we get back to regular work.
In the evening, Utkarsh and I started planning for next day's events where Noopur and Sachin went out to bring us some Goa vibes shirts.
