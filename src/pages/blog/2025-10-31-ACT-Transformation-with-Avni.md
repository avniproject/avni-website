#### Animedh Charitable Trust’s Transformation with Avni

At Animedh Charitable Trust (ACT), our mission is to empower underprivileged communities through education, health, and livelihood programmes. As our work expanded, we realised our data systems needed to evolve too.
Managing information through paper forms and spreadsheets had become time-consuming and prone to errors — affecting our ability to make timely, data-driven decisions.
That’s when we began our journey with Avni, Samanvay Foundation’s open-source platform designed for field data collection and management in the social sector.

### Why We Chose Avni

When we discovered Avni, we were drawn to how it blended flexibility, offline functionality, and ease of use — all essential for organisations working in the field. The fact that it could work seamlessly in areas with limited internet connectivity made it ideal for our programmes.

The onboarding process was smooth and inclusive. Samanvay’s team provided hands-on training sessions for our field staff, many of whom were using a digital system for the first time. With Avni’s regional language support and user-friendly interface, the transition from paper to mobile data entry felt achievable.

### A Hybrid Approach to Digital Adoption

Like many NGOs, we operate with limited resources and technical capacity. To make the most of Avni within our means, we adopted a hybrid model — using self-service for simpler configurations and relying on the Avni team for more complex setups.

This approach helped us manage costs while building in-house digital capacity, supported by Samanvay’s responsive guidance.

### The Change on the Ground

With Avni, our field officers now record beneficiary details, service updates, and community feedback directly on their smartphones — even in remote villages. Data syncs automatically once connectivity resumes, giving our management team near real-time insights into programme performance.

**1. Greater accuracy:**</br>
Direct digital entry means fewer errors and duplications.

**2. Enhanced transparency:**</br>
Real-time visibility has strengthened accountability with funders.

**3. Empowered staff:**</br>
Field workers feel confident and valued using a tool built for their realities.

### Learning Through Change

Transitioning to a new digital system wasn’t without challenges. Some initial resistance and technical hiccups were natural. But with ongoing support from Samanvay and continuous learning, our team adapted quickly.

We also onboarded a Programme Lead, an M&E expert, and a Data Officer — a move that improved data alignment and ensured that every insight we gathered was both accurate and actionable.

### Looking Ahead

Transitioning to a new digital system wasn’t without challenges. Some initial resistance and technical hiccups were natural. But with ongoing support from Samanvay and continuous learning, our team adapted quickly.

For ACT, Avni has not just digitised data — it has strengthened our foundation for impact.
