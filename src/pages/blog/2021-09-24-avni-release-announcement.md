**What's new:**


**File data type**

Users will now be able to attach files like pdf, doc to upload test results, meeting minutes, etc.

**Other Minor Enhancements**
- Ability to show answers in form in alphabetical or custom order
- Scheduled, Overdue and other cards in Default MyDashboard will respect the filters selected by users e.g. program or visit type.
- Ability for admins to set a custom password when creating a user and reset password for existing users.
