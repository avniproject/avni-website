The Avni 2025 conference, held on January 23rd and 24th, brought together leaders, innovators, and changemakers in the social impact sector to discuss emerging trends and practical tech solutions for nonprofit challenges. Here are my reflections on key sessions that stood out and some actionable insights.

## 1. Democratisation of Data  

**Session Highlights:**  
Pratima from Shelter Associates showcased how leveraging primary data not only drives impactful internal programs but also provides invaluable insights for governments and public stakeholders. The discussion emphasized data as a public good and its transformative potential for social change.  

**Reflections:**  
One of my key takeaways was the challenge and opportunity of responsibly sharing collected data. We need frameworks that ensure data privacy while enabling other organizations to benefit from existing data, reducing duplication of effort. Partnering with government bodies to make such data accessible through public repositories could be a scalable approach. Creating anonymized datasets and establishing secure data-sharing agreements are practical steps toward this goal.  

## 2. Self-Servicing Model Overview  

**Session Highlights:**  
This session explored collaborative approaches to simplifying the program design process in Avni. Organizations shared insights on streamlining workflows and making program design faster, smoother, and more effective.  

**Reflections:**  
A promising observation was the interest shown by some organizations in adopting a self-servicing model. With proper upskilling and support from Samanvay Foundation, organizations could independently manage program design and implementation. Effective training modules paired with structured support during the first two months of Avni rollouts are critical. Regular check-ins can ensure smoother transitions and address any early-stage challenges.  

## 3. Fundraising for Technology  

**Session Highlights:**  
This session tackled common hurdles in securing funding for technology in nonprofit programs and shared strategies for more successful grant applications.  

**Reflections:**  
To make technology an integral part of program budgets, nonprofits should position it as a crucial component for enhancing operational efficiency. Demonstrating tangible benefits—such as improved data collection and reporting—can help win funder support. Additionally, organizations like Tech4Dev and Samanvay Foundation could offer valuable guidance on crafting compelling tech pitches and framing technology as a strategic investment.  

## 4. Myths and Realities of AI  

**Session Highlights:**  
This session demystified AI by exploring its practical applications, the variety of chatbot models available, and essential considerations when integrating AI into nonprofit operations.  

**Reflections:**  
It was insightful to understand the various AI chatbot models and their effective applications. A key takeaway was the need to train NGOs on using AI to streamline daily operations, improve program management, and optimize communications. Leveraging open resources such as ChatGPT, translation models, and data analytics tools can significantly boost productivity. AI can be used to generate donor reports, analyze beneficiary data patterns, and automate routine tasks, freeing up time for strategic thinking.  

## 5. Amplifying Avni's Influence and Reach  

**Session Highlights:**  
The discussion centered on strategies to expand Avni’s reach and influence among nonprofits and other stakeholders.  

**Reflections:**  
Key suggestions included:  
- Organizing in-person technology conferences to showcase Avni’s capabilities.  
- Participating in NGO partner events and social impact consultancy gatherings.  
- Leveraging social media platforms for awareness campaigns.  
- Engaging close funder forums such as RNPF and collectives such as the Bihar Development Collective.  
- Building relationships with existing NGO partners and implementation networks to spread Avni’s impact.

By applying these reflections, we can collectively work toward more inclusive, tech-enabled solutions for the nonprofit sector.
