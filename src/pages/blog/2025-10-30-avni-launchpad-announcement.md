#### Announcing the Avni Launchpad Cohort 1

Many NGOs running field-based programs are still on paper/spreadsheet-based or expensive systems. They want to switch to Avni, but sometimes struggle to make the leap or convince the decision makers of the value. So we are launching a very quick and in-expensive way to see the value of using Avni before investing further. 

The Avni Launchpad is a unique program tailored for NGOsand social enterprises ready to take their first big step in digital transformation. Over a focused few weeks, selected organizations receive hands-on mentoring, tailored support, and free access to Avni’s robust platform to launch a real, working digital pilot that elevates program monitoring, field data, and reporting.

### Why Join the program?

If you are an NGO looking to digitise your field-work, this workshop lets you digitally translate your program and see the value of it before investing further. Through guided learning, peer support, and powerful tools, we help you bring your idea to life - from concept to pilot - with confidence and ease.

### What You Get
- The program:
  - A blend of online sessions and an in-person workshop where we discuss good data practices, program definition, and learn to use Avni
  - Practical training with guidance at every step
  - Work alongside peers, share ideas, and solve challenges together
  - Learn how to scope your use case and design a full-fledged fieldwork MIS
  - Wrap up with a working prototype ready to test with your community

- Incentives:
  - Free Avni hosting & support (worth up to ₹ 30,000) until end of program
  - 10% discount on annual subscription, up to ₹ 21,000 for continued subscription beyond end of program

  - Community Benefits:
  - Join the Avni community - network with a vibrant group of change-makers
  - Ongoing support to scale your digital journey

### Who Should Apply
You are an NGO who has 
- **Clear need for Avni** - Avni fits best when you have a program that is run through a field workforce, and service is provided over a period of time. Case studies on the website may help understand this more. If you are still not sure, please contact us through avnipartnerships@samanvayfoundation.org to discuss further.
- **Bandwidth** - You can nominate someone in the organisation who will drive the pilot. The participant
  - Knows the pilot use-case
  - Can spend 5–7 hours a week working on pilot scope, Avni setup and pilot rollout during the launchpad program timelines
  - Is comfortable with using smartphones, spreadsheets and setting up drop-down based applications like google forms.
  - Can attend a 2-day workshop in Bangalore
- **Funds** - If you think the pilot works fine, you must be able to pay SaaS fees to continue with the work beyond the pilot phase. While you can make the decision on whether you would want to continue depending on the success of the pilot, it will be useful to know in advance if you would be able to raise funds if you find the app valuable
