Release 3.40.0 is now live.  

## Notable Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Media Viewer
The web console has a new member - Media Viewer !!!
The Media Viewer helps view all the media that you have uploaded in the app - pics, videos etc, and lets you filter and download these images in bulk. It is available for all organisation admins on organisations that have enabled analytics. Media will be available under one hour after upload to the Avni server.

See the [documentation](https://avni.readme.io/docs/media-viewer) for more details. Please take a look, and provide feedback. If you see anything missing, you can report it [here](https://github.com/avniproject/avni-media/issues).

Last names are optional now. Make the optional on the subject type, and it will be available, but will not mandate a last name.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Show and persist Custom Dashboard Filters
You will now be able to see the filters that have been applied on CustomDashboard cards. These are also persisted across app relaunches, until the user effects a change manually or there is a change in the Dashboard filter configuration coming in as part of a sync.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What else is happening in Avni?
In 4.0.0, we will be completing the first set of work for Access control of the web application and App Designer. There are quite a few other small items that are being worked on.  

Additionally, there are some changes in the Avni processes, which includes release naming conventions, release processes, a public product roadmap handling and communications. The purpose of these changes is to provide more visibility into the inner workings of product releases. You can read more about it in [**this**](https://avniproject.org/blog/2023-07-07-opening-up/) blog .


### Special mentions
Rudresh Shrotriya and Brajesh Kumar from [ColoredCow](https://coloredcow.com/) for their work on the Media Viewer.
