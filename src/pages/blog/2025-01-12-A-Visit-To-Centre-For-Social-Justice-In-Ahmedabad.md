Earlier this month, I had the privilege of visiting the [Centre for Social Justice (CSJ)](https://www.centreforsocialjustice.net) office in Ahmedabad, accompanied by CSJ's Managing Trustee and a team of project coordinators and leadership members. This visit provided a valuable opportunity to engage deeply with the work CSJ undertakes and to understand the nuances of their operations.

## Understanding the Mission

CSJ has been a beacon of hope for marginalised communities, working tirelessly to ensure justice and equity. Their objectives are centred around empowering individuals through legal aid, capacity building, and advocacy. During our discussions, the team highlighted the importance of their on-ground efforts in addressing systemic issues and enabling sustainable change.

## Insights into Operations

The visit allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of CSJ’s operational model. I learnt how CSJ plans the roster for each team across three different states. These activities consist of conducting new outreach and campaigns where they explain the rights of labourers, children, and women, and identify the legal battles individuals might wish to pursue. CSJ also supports individuals in their ongoing legal battles.

From strategising field activities to managing case documentation, their meticulous approach ensures that every initiative is impactful. It was inspiring to witness how their team collaborates across various levels to address challenges effectively.

## The Data Cleaning Process

One of the key highlights of our visit was delving into CSJ’s data cleaning process. I gained insights into how the process is carried out, starting with each team consisting of an average of four paralegals or lawyers who exchange data with one another to verify the case or claim theme, actions taken, and personal details. This ensures the legal details provided are accurate.  

I also learned how a unit manager verifies the data within their unit and subsequently exchanges it with the program manager as the next step in the data cleaning process. This layered approach ensures thorough cross-verification, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the data.

## Reporting and Impact Assessment

We also explored the reports generated by CSJ to evaluate the impact of their programmes. I learnt how CSJ loads the data into their SPSS system, from where the reporting happens. The objective of this reporting is to demonstrate the progress and work accomplished on the ground to their funders. These reports are instrumental in showcasing the outcomes of their work and identifying areas for improvement. It was fascinating to see how data-driven insights are integrated into their strategy, ensuring that their efforts remain aligned with their objectives.

## A Collaborative Future

This visit reinforced the importance of collaboration in driving social impact. Our discussions with the leadership team and project coordinators opened up avenues for potential partnerships and knowledge exchange. We left the office with a deeper appreciation for the incredible work CSJ does and a renewed commitment to supporting their mission.
