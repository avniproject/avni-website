Taking over and understanding technology tools within the Sustainable Rural Development vertical at the **A.T.E. Chandra Foundation (ATECF)** has been a great learning experience. Organizations like **Project Tech4Dev** are revolutionizing how NGOs utilize data, ultimately helping them scale their impact.

Recently, I had the opportunity to attend the Dalgo Sprint and the Avni Conference in the picturesque town of Mahabalipuram. These events provided a platform to meet the Tech4Dev and Samanvay teams, network with NGOs, and explore how Dalgo and Avni simplify data management, collection, and visualization for the social sector.

## **Dalgo Sprint – Strengthening Data Culture in NGOs**

### **Day 1: Engaging Icebreakers & Insights on Dalgo**
The conference started with a fun icebreaker session, where participants shared:  
- How they are using **Dalgo**.  
- Feature improvements they would like to see.  
- Common challenges, which we noted on sticky notes and placed on feedback charts.

Through this session, I connected with Aditya Krishnan from Goalkeep, who introduced me to how his organization is fostering a data culture within NGOs.

The session **"Keeping Dalgo Humming"** provided deeper insights into Dalgo’s functionalities** and upcoming enhancements such as data visualization and AI integration. Understanding these aspects helped me connect the dots between Dalgo’s backend processes and ATECF’s dashboard on Superset.

I also had insightful discussions with Prateeksha and Siddhant from the Dalgo team on:  
- **Integrating maps** into ATECF’s dashboard for a better user experience.  
- **Decluttering existing graphs** to enhance usability and increase engagement.

The day concluded with a relaxing walk to the resort’s private beach, allowing for informal networking with other attendees.

### **Day 2: AI, Qualitative Data & Practical Data Challenges**
The highlight of the second day was a **session on AI**, led by Prateeksha and Sanjeev. The discussion covered key AI concepts such as:  
- **Token limits & context windows**  
- **Chat poisoning & model biases**  
- **How AI tools analyze qualitative data**

We conducted a live activity using a demo dataset, where Large Language Models (LLMs) were used to extract insights and quantify qualitative data. It was eye-opening to see how AI can automate reporting tasks and improve efficiency.

Some AI tools discussed included:  
- **Notebook LM** for document analysis.  
- **Document 360** for knowledge management.  

Later, in an interactive session with Aditya Krishnan from Goalkeep, NGOs identified data-related issues and partnered with the Tech4Dev team to brainstorm solutions for streamlining data workflows.

## **Avni Conference – Leveraging Data for Social Impact**

### **Day 3: Learning from NGOs Using Avni**
The Avni Conference introduced me to the Samanvay team and various NGOs working in disaster relief, public health, and legal aid. It was fascinating to see how these diverse organizations use **Avni** for on-ground data collection, preferring it over tools like Kobo and CommCare.

Key highlights of the day:  
- A session on Avni’s transformation from OpenCHS to its current versatile platform.  
- A short film on Shelter Associates, celebrating their 30-year journey and use of Avni for urban slum mapping.  
- An insightful conversation with Pratima Joshi (Founder, Shelter Associates) on NGO data-sharing for collective impact.

Another critical discussion focused on **fundraising for tech adoption in the social sector**. NGOs shared their experiences in convincing funders to invest in technology, emphasizing that:  
- Strong data systems improve on-ground implementation.  
- Evidence-backed data** strengthens impact reporting.  
- Contracts and MoUs should include tech infrastructure clauses.

The final session of the day was a **hands-on workshop on building dashboards** using **Metabase and Superset**, providing practical insights into visualizing Avni-collected data.

### **Day 4: Expanding Avni’s Impact**
The conference concluded with a session on **scaling Avni’s impact**, where stakeholders proposed key strategies:  
- Leveraging networks to promote Avni’s benefits.  
- Involving Samanvay team members in government interactions.  
- Conducting field visits to refine the user experience.

I also connected with Taqi and Nayaz from Samanvay, who work closely with ATECF, discussing their contributions to co-creating the **Avni Gramin app**.

## **Final Thoughts**
Both the **Dalgo Sprint** and the **Avni Conference** were fantastic opportunities to:  
✅ Deepen my understanding of **Dalgo and Avni**.  
✅ Build relationships with the **Project Tech4Dev & Samanvay teams**.  
✅ Network with NGOs to explore tech-driven social impact.  

I look forward to attending more such conferences to collaborate on building stronger tech ecosystems for the social sector in India.
