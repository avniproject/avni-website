So my excitement started somewhere around mid-June when Arjun informed us that we would be participating in the Tech4Dev sponsored Udaipur sprint.

The day finally arrived when I had my bags packed and was on my way to the airport, ready to experience the vibrant air of Rajasthan.

Upon reaching the hotel, I warmly greeted and embraced my remote team members. We quickly gathered to discuss the week's schedule, aiming to make the trip both productive and unforgettable.

The first official day began the next morning, with each team member sharing their typical workday routine, the challenges they face, and what constitutes a successful working day.

Soon, the work sessions were in full swing, with teams collaborating on tasks, taking advantage of the rare opportunity to work closely together.

## Key memories of mine

- The first breakfast with my team at the resort (and the delightful chocolate glazed donuts, of course).

- The enlightening session on "Ease of Implementation," where we brainstormed the daily challenges we face as implementers and explored potential solutions to simplify the process.

- A memorable team outing at Lake Pichola, followed by indulging in the delicious Rajasthani delicacy, Dal Baati Churma, at Khambagani.

- The thrilling team activity called "Beg Borrow Steal," where two teams were formed and given a set of tasks and items to complete. The first team to finish emerged victorious.

### These were just a few of the many incredible moments that made our Udaipur sprint an unforgettable experience.
