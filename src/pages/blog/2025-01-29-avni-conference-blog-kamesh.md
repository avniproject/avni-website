Visiting Chennai for the first time was an incredible experience, and every moment, from the beginning of my journey to the very end, was truly amazing.

I arrived at the breathtaking venue of Mahabalipuram at the break of dawn on January 23rd. The warm hospitality of the Chariot Hotel staff made me feel instantly welcome as they escorted me to my room. The serene surroundings, with birds chirping and lush greenery all around, set the perfect tone for the days ahead.

## Day 1 – A Power-Packed Start

The first day was filled with enriching sessions aimed at empowering participating NGOs.

We kicked off with Vinay Venu (Avni Team) giving a quick, yet insightful recap of Avni’s journey in 2024 and an exciting glimpse into what’s in store for 2025.

Next, Pratima Joshi from [Shelter Associates](https://shelter-associates.org/) captivated us with her session on leveraging data for impactful change. What stood out the most was how the organization makes all its data publicly accessible on its website. This sparked a mix of awe and curiosity, leading to a deep discussion about data transparency and its implications. Pratima answered all the questions gracefully, leaving everyone inspired.

Gopal Kulkarni from [IHMP](https://www.ihmp.org/) continued the sessions while sharing his key insights about using Avni and how leveraging technology has benefited them to impact lives across their intervention areas.

Post-break, we gathered for a series of engaging lightning talks:
- Yogish CB ([Institute of Public Health](https://iphindia.org/))
- Ashok Kumar (Independent Consultant)
- Sukhdev Mahto ([Collectives for Integrated Livelihood Initiatives](https://cinicell.org/))

Each of them shared their unique experiences of using data to drive impact, offering valuable insights that resonated with everyone.

After a delicious lunch, the much-anticipated session of the day took centre stage. Pratiksha Rao ([Tech4Dev](https://projecttech4dev.org/)) introduced us to powerful tools that could drastically reduce the time spent on routine activities—from hours to mere minutes. Initially, the audience was quiet, but as she unveiled the possibilities, excitement built up. The session quickly turned into the most interactive one of the day, with questions flying and discussions buzzing on how these tools could be applied across different verticals.

Following a short tea break, we dove into three parallel sessions based on individual interests:
- Generating BI reports on Metabase
- Generating BI reports on Superset
- Self-servicing Hackathon

These sessions were a massive hit! Afterwards, conversations revolved around the practical applications of what had been learned and how these tools could be leveraged effectively.

As the day wrapped up, we took the opportunity to engage in one-on-one discussions with NGOs, addressing their implementation challenges. By the end of the evening, every NGO participant walked away either with an immediate solution or the assurance that their concerns would be prioritized.

## Day 2 – A Blend of Learning & Connection

After a restful night, many attendees took the opportunity to explore. Some enjoyed an early morning dip in the ocean, while others relaxed by the pool or ventured out to nearby sightseeing spots.

The sessions resumed with Mahalashme S (Avni Team) walking us through the latest features in Avni, as well as a sneak peek at upcoming developments. This session was particularly valuable as it gave everyone a clearer understanding of what’s next for the platform.

After a refreshing tea break and a group photo, the energy levels remained high as Arjun (Avni Team) introduced an engaging game that encouraged more interaction. This was a fun way for participants to connect with those they hadn’t had a chance to speak with earlier.

The final session focused on increasing Avni’s visibility nationwide and gathering feedback on potential improvements. The discussions that followed were filled with innovative ideas and valuable suggestions, reinforcing the endless possibilities for Avni’s growth.

## Final Thoughts

Since this was my first sprint with NGOs, it was a truly enriching experience. I had the chance to forge meaningful connections with both new and existing partners. These interactions have deepened my understanding of their challenges and aspirations, allowing me to offer solutions with greater empathy and insight.

This journey to Mahabalipuram was not just about knowledge-sharing—it was about building relationships, learning together, and envisioning the future of impactful data-driven solutions. I’m already looking forward to what comes next!
