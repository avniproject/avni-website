We're excited to share what's new in Avni this December! This release brings smarter AI-powered tools, ready-to-use templates, and richer media support to help you get started faster and deliver better on-field experiences.

Let's take a look at what's new.

### 📋 Get Started Faster with Templates

Earlier this year, we simplified the self-signup process on Avni. Now, we're taking it a step further with **Templates**—pre-built configurations for common use cases that you can apply with just a click.

Whether you're working in healthcare, water management, or social welfare, these templates give you a head start:
<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; padding: 30px;">  
    <img src="/img/2025-12-23-avni-release-announcement/Templates.png" 
         style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 800px; display: block;">
</div>

We plan to continue adding more templates in the future to help cover more use cases.

### 🤖 AI Assistant Gets Smarter

We introduced the Avni AI Assistant in August this year to help users understand and navigate the platform. Now, it's even more powerful—helping you perform initial setup of your organisation with simple conversations. Just tell the assistant what you need, and it can help you create location type hierarchy, set up your Subject types, Programs and Encounter types.

We've also added two new AI-powered features:

**Smart Form Suggestions** – As you design forms, Avni now provides helpful suggestions and warnings to ensure your forms are set up correctly.

<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; padding: 30px;">  
    <img src="/img/2025-12-23-avni-release-announcement/FormValidationAIWarnings.png" 
         style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 800px; display: block;">
</div>

**Automated Visit Scheduling** – Describe your visit scheduling needs in plain language, and the AI will generate the scheduling rules for you. No coding required!

<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; padding: 30px;">  
    <img src="/img/2025-12-23-avni-release-announcement/CreateVisitScheduleRuleWithAI.png" 
         style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 800px; display: block;">
</div>

We've received great feedback on these AI features from participants in our Avni Launchpad program, and we have an exciting roadmap for more AI-powered capabilities across app setup, data collection, and reporting.

### 🎬 Videos in Forms

Previously, you could add images to questions and answer options—helpful for field workers who may find visual cues easier to understand. Based on community feedback, we've now extended this to support **videos** as well!

This is especially useful for showing demonstrations, instructions, or visual confirmations to beneficiaries during data collection.

<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; padding: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">  
    <img src="/img/2025-12-23-avni-release-announcement/VideoAndImagesInConcepts.png"
