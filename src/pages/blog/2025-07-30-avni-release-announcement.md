We're excited to introduce Avni 14.0.0! This release is all about enhancing your experienceâ€”with smarter features, improved performance, and tools that make day-to-day work smoother. 

Let's take a look at what's new in this version.

### ðŸ“± Save Space on Your Phone by Skipping Unnecessary Data

As organisations continue using Avni, some records may no longer need to be actively trackedâ€”for example, cases that are closed. Until now, even these records were still downloaded to users' phones, taking up unnecessary space.

With this update, Avni can now be configured to skip downloading such dataâ€”helping save storage on mobile devices. This also means the app will download data faster and perform more smoothlyâ€”for example, searches will be quicker and dashboards will load faster.

### ðŸ”¹ Smarter Address Handling: Auto-Copy for New Group Members

When adding a new member to a group, manually re-entering the group address often led to errors. To prevent this, Avni now auto-populates the address based on the groupâ€”improving data accuracy and saving time.
