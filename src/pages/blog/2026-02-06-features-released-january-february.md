We're excited to share the latest features that have been rolled out in January and February! This update focuses on improving field worker experience with better navigation capabilities, enhanced issue reporting, and significant performance improvements for data uploads.

Let's explore what's new in this release.

### 📍 Location Navigation

Field workers can now easily save and navigate to beneficiary locations. When at a beneficiary's residence, field workers can click the add location icon to save the beneficiary's precise location. Once saved, they can tap the location to navigate back to it anytime.

With offline maps downloaded, field workers can navigate to saved locations even without an internet connection—ensuring uninterrupted fieldwork in remote areas.

### 🛠️ Ability to Report Issues (Uploading Logs)

We've made it easier for users to report issues and get support. When a user encounters an issue, they can now click "Upload issue info" on the error alert that appears. This automatically uploads diagnostic logs to our server, helping us debug and resolve issues faster.

</div>

For situations where there's no error alert, users can access this feature by clicking "More" on the home page, then selecting "Upload app info." This ensures comprehensive support coverage for all types of issues.

### ⚡ Enhancements in Data Upload Performance

Bundle uploads are now significantly faster! We've optimized the data upload process by no longer updating concepts that haven't changed. This enhancement reduces upload time and improves overall app performance, especially for organizations with large datasets.

A big thank you to all our partners and field workers for their valuable feedback and suggestions. Your input helps us continuously improve Avni to better serve your needs.
