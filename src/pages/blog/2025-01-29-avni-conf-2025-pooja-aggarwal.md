The tranquil town of **Mahabalipuram**, with its stunning coastline, set the perfect stage for the **Avni 2025 workshop**, an annual event I eagerly look forward to attending.  

Avni, a **community service and data collection platform**, has become a **lifeline for NGOs** across diverse sectors, including **Health, Education, Sanitation, Agriculture, Legal Aid**, and many more. This workshop brought together **many NGOs, including mine (IPH Bengaluru)**, to share updates, engage in hands-on activities, and discuss the future of **tech-based, community-driven solutions**. The event was a testament to how **digital tools** can enhance grassroots efforts and transform lives.  

## Workshop Highlights  

Although all sessions and lightning talks** were insightful, these were some of the key takeaways for me:  

### **1. Democratization of Data**  
**Pratima Joshi** from **Shelter Associates** stressed the need to make **data accessible to all stakeholders**. This not only empowers government efforts to reach underserved communities but also helps attract **funding opportunities**.  

### **2. The Impact of Digitization on Health Services**  
**Gopal Kulkarni** from **IHMP, Panchod**, shared inspiring examples of how **digital tools** are **revolutionizing healthcare delivery and research**.  

### **3. Hands-on Workshop with Superset Reports**  
A particularly useful session provided **practical insights** into **creating and analyzing data-driven reports using Superset**.  

### **4. Leveraging AI for the Social Sector**  
A fascinating talk by **Pratiksha from Tech4Dev** introduced us to **AI tools** for handling **mundane daily tasks** like note-taking, writing emails, and even **presentation and data analysis**.  

## The Power of Collaboration  

The workshop’s well-structured agenda balanced informal discussions with interactive, skill-building activities**, ensuring that every participant could share their journey and experiences.  

It was insightful to learn about Avni’s recent updates, and the brainstorming session on Avni’s sustainability was particularly engaging. I personally felt that Avni’s contributions need more visibility, either through:  

- Co-authored articles
- Acknowledgments by partners on their websites
- Highlighting social impact through a dashboard on Avni’s website

## Exploring Mahabalipuram  

Beyond the conference rooms and delicious cuisine, I had the opportunity to explore the beauty and history of Shore Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its intricate carvings and the serene Bay of Bengal backdrop provided a perfect mix of relaxation and inspiration.

## Final Thoughts  

As I left on the final day with renewed energy and a deeper connection to both my peer NGOs and the causes they champion, I realized that the Avni workshop is more than an annual event**—it is a **movement towards a more equitable and empowered world!
