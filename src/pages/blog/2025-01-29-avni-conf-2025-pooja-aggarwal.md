The tranquil town of **Mahabalipuram**, with its stunning coastline, set the perfect stage for the Avni 2025 workshop, an annual event I eagerly look forward to attending.  

Avni, a community service and data collection platform, has become a lifeline for NGOs across diverse sectors, including Health, Education, Sanitation, Agriculture, Legal Aid, and many more. This workshop brought together many NGOs, including mine (IPH Bengaluru), to share updates, engage in hands-on activities, and discuss the future of tech-based, community-driven solutions. The event was a testament to how digital tools can enhance grassroots efforts and transform lives.

## Workshop Highlights  

Although all sessions and lightning talks were insightful, these were some of the key takeaways for me:  

### 1. Democratization of Data 
Pratima Joshi from [Shelter Associates](https://shelter-associates.org/) stressed the need to make data accessible to all stakeholders. This not only empowers government efforts to reach underserved communities but also helps attract funding opportunities.  

### 2. The Impact of Digitization on Health Services 
Gopal Kulkarni from [IHMP, Pachod](https://www.ihmp.org/), shared inspiring examples of how digital tools are **revolutionizing healthcare delivery and research**.  

### 3. Hands-on Workshop with Superset Reports 
A particularly useful session provided practical insights into creating and analyzing data-driven reports using Superset.

### 4. Leveraging AI for the Social Sector 
A fascinating talk by Pratiksha from Tech4Dev introduced us to AI tools for handling mundane daily tasks like note-taking, writing emails, and even presentation and data analysis.  

## The Power of Collaboration  

The workshop’s well-structured agenda balanced informal discussions with interactive, skill-building activities**, ensuring that every participant could share their journey and experiences.  

It was insightful to learn about Avni’s recent updates, and the brainstorming session on Avni’s sustainability was particularly engaging. I personally felt that Avni’s contributions need more visibility, either through:  

- Co-authored articles
- Acknowledgments by partners on their websites
- Highlighting social impact through a dashboard on Avni’s website

## Exploring Mahabalipuram  

Beyond the conference rooms and delicious cuisine, I had the opportunity to explore the beauty and history of Shore Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its intricate carvings and the serene Bay of Bengal backdrop provided a perfect mix of relaxation and inspiration.

## Final Thoughts  
As I left on the final day with renewed energy and a deeper connection to both my peer NGOs and the causes they champion, I realized that <span style="color:#ff470f">the Avni workshop is more than an annual event—it is a movement towards a more equitable and empowered world!</span>
