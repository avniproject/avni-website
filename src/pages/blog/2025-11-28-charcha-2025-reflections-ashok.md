Attending Charcha 2025 at the India Habitat Centre was a refreshing reminder of what is possible when technology, community, and collaboration come together with purpose. Over three days, as more than 1,500 people from government, civil society, and markets gathered under one roof, the conversations reaffirmed a simple truth: meaningful social impact is built through trust, shared learning, and a willingness to keep evolving.

## Technology at the Grassroots: Beyond Tools, Toward Trust

One of the most insightful sessions for me was "Leveraging Technology at the Grassroots for Scalable Impact." The fireside chat featuring Aradhana from Project Bala and Antaraa Vasudev from Civis highlighted not just why NGOs adopt technology, but how they navigate that journey—balancing ambition with the realities of capacity, culture, and community trust.

Their stories, along with lightning talks by Saajha and Indus Action, made a powerful point: choosing the "right tech" is rarely a one-time decision. It is an ongoing process of experimentation, learning, and unlearning. What struck me most was the honesty with which each organization acknowledged their missteps, iterations, and the importance of listening closely to the people they serve.

## Breakout Conversations: Tech, Capacity & the Human Layer

I had the chance to facilitate two breakout discussions, both of which reaffirmed how deeply human the conversation around technology really is.

### 1. Building Community Trust in Technology
Participants reflected on how data is collected in the communities they work with, and whether this process is transparent enough. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023) came up frequently prompting discussions on how NGOs can prepare for evolving governance requirements.

### 2. Building Tech Capacity Within NGOs
The second discussion centered on leadership readiness and digital skilling. Many agreed that even the best tools fail when teams do not feel confident using them, or when the organizational culture is resistant to change. The most successful tech journeys, we found, are the ones where people not platforms are prioritized.

What stood out to me was the willingness of participants to share real challenges: failed pilots, staff hesitation, infrastructure gaps. These unfiltered stories offered valuable insights into what it takes to build tech-forward NGOs that remain empathetic and grounded.

## Conversations in Corridors: Meeting the Changemakers

Outside the formal sessions, some of the most meaningful interactions happened in the hallways and courtyard. I met:

- A young couple helping education nonprofits improve content quality and program delivery through digital tools.
- A program associate working on a child-tracking and accountability portal used by childcare institutions and government departments.
- An advocate exploring storytelling and culture through an initiative called Gyankosh, capturing narratives from across India.

These conversations reminded me that innovation in the social sector is not always loud or flashy. Often, it is driven by small teams experimenting quietly, guided by empathy and persistence.

## A Cross-Sector Learning Space

Throughout the event, I moved across themes ranging from assistive technology and disabilities to livelihoods, inclusion, entrepreneurship, and rural development. The diversity of sessions and people made Charcha feel less like a conference and more like a living ecosystem of ideas.

A standout was the session on Assistive Technology for Livelihoods and Inclusion, which showcased how tech can remove barriers rather than create them. Later in the day, interactions with grassroots storytellers, skilling organizations, and researchers expanded my understanding of the many approaches underway to strengthen India's development landscape.

I also had opportunities to share Samanvay Foundation's work, especially how open-source tools like Avni support NGOs in becoming data-driven and building efficient, tech-enabled systems. Many organizations were eager to understand how such tools could empower their field teams or help them measure outcomes more effectively.

## Looking Ahead: Why Convenings Like Charcha Matter

What made Charcha 2025 meaningful for me was not just the sessions, it was the spirit of openness, curiosity, and collaboration that connected them all. Every conversation, whether on data protection or community engagement, reinforced that technology is only as impactful as the trust it is built upon.

As the development sector continues to evolve, convenings like Charcha provide something irreplaceable: a space to listen, exchange, reflect, and reimagine. They spark new partnerships, deepen old ones, and remind us that change happens when we bring diverse voices to the same table, voices rooted in lived experience, innovation, and a shared commitment to equitable development.

I walked away from Charcha 2025 with renewed energy and a clearer conviction: technology can accelerate impact, but it must always be guided by people, values, and accountability. And in moments when the path feels uncertain, gatherings like Charcha serve as a compass, grounding us in community and pushing us toward collective action.
