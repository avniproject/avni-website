Maharashtra government has initiated the implementation of <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/maharashtra-to-desilt-dams-water-bodies/article9691614.ece" target="_blank">its policy decision on desilting of dams and water bodies</a>. The implementation is happening in partnership with the NGOs. In 2018–19, in order to monitor the process and progress of the desilting and distribution of silt - the project required a field-based data collection and a monitoring system.

The model for data collection involved registering each dam/water-body and then collecting various types of information like - baseline, work details of vehicle's used, issues faced, the beneficiary details and end-line. This data is collected in the field during the complete process of desilting and distribution of silt. The collected data allowed for monitoring based on gaps in reporting and anomalies in data. The monitoring team could contact the ground team to understand the reasons.

**Using Avni field app from the field**

There are certain features of Avni that helped in monitoring of the groundwork. The user was expected to provide their location when they are filling the data to ensure that they were at the site of work. Also, the users could record a video or take photos of the desilting work. Avni makes is possible to do all of these along with regular data collection work completely offline. Server interaction is only required when one wants to submit the data.

**Flexible user-defined data model**

As can be seen from this implementation that the subject of data collected was not a human being (i.e. beneficiary, child, mother, patient etc), rather it is a non-living object like a dam. Avni supports such use cases in the same way. It is important to mention here, that Avni can support individual human being a subject and one or more non-living objects being subjects - within the same implementation. For example - Avni can support a village health program that requires managing data of villagers (beneficiaries), self-help groups and water wells.

In terms of some numbers - around 300 users used Avni mobile app in the field to collect data, covering around 3000 dams and water bodies.
