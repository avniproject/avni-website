India is facing an escalating water crisis. With the country’s water supply rapidly dwindling, [experts have warned that by 2030, India may fall into the category of "water-stressed nations](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/by-2030-indias-water-demand-to-be-twice-the-available-supply-indicating-severe-water-scarcity-report/articleshow/64679218.cms?from=mdr)," with per capita water availability dropping below sustainable levels.

To address this issue, the Rejuvenation of Waterbodies (RWB) Project by the [A.T.E. Chandra Foundation](https://www.ategroup.com/csr/#tab2) (ATECF) is making strides in restoring neglected water bodies throughout India. ATECF focuses on revitalising ponds, lakes, and other water bodies that have been neglected due to sedimentation and other issues, helping to increase their storage capacity and improve access to water for rural communities.

It has been driving large-scale waterbody rejuvenation efforts across nine states in India, including Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and more.


## Need for Digitisation:

As the efforts to restore water bodies grow, the need for a streamlined, transparent way to manage and track the progress of restoration activities becomes crucial.

To solve this, [ATECF collaborated with Avni and started using the Avni Gramin App](https://projecttech4dev.org/waterbody-rejuvenation-project-a-t-e-chandra-foundation/) as a digital tool for data collection for their Community Resource Persons (CRPs) working in the field.

The Avni-Gramin App makes it easier to collect, store, and manage data related to waterbody restoration, such as silt removal, bund strengthening, and other critical interventions. The app’s simple interface and offline functionality ensure that even in areas with limited connectivity, data can still be recorded and updated.

- **Geotagging and GPS Tracking:** The app enables tracking GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of a site to check coordinates accuracy.
- **WhatsApp Chatbot for Quick Support:** With Glific integration, the app is linked to a WhatsApp chatbot that provides instant assistance to the field users, answering questions about data entry or project details.
- **Mobile Number Uniqueness:** A check is done on mobile number uniqueness to identify potential duplicates or fraudulent entries.
- **OTP Verification:** A One-Time Password (OTP) verification system ensures that all user data is secure and verified, enhancing the overall trustworthiness of the platform.
- **Structured Data Entry:** Customisable forms make it easy to enter data in a structured and consistent manner, ensuring accuracy in reporting and decision-making.

## Scale and Credibility

The Rejuvenating Water Bodies (RWB) project and the Avni platform were featured in the [Economic Survey of India 2024–25](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/doc/eschapter/echap09.pdf) as a model of how grassroots efforts can be amplified through digital innovation. While RWB brings large-scale impact through community-led waterbody restoration, Avni enables this scale with structured, real-time data collection—even in remote areas. Their combined approach is now gaining national and global recognition as a replicable model for tech-enabled rural development.
