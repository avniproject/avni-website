In the bustling streets of Indian cities, waste often seems invisible. But behind every clean neighbourhood is a group of people whose labour remains largely unrecognised—the waste pickers.

Established in Bangalore, India, **Hasiru Dala** (meaning “green force” in Kannada) is changing that. The organisation empowers waste pickers by recognising their contributions, securing their rights, and integrating them into formal waste management systems.

## 🧩 The Challenge: Paper-Based Chaos

Despite strong grassroots engagement, the Hasiru Dala team faced growing operational hurdles as its programs expanded:

- Records kept on paper were prone to being misplaced or having spelling mistakes.
- Follow-ups were inefficient, requiring teams to carry bulky folders and sift through files to access individual records and service histories.
- Generating reports was delayed, as field staff had to manually enter data into spreadsheets after returning from the field.

This slowed down operations, increased the chance of errors, and made real-time decision-making difficult.

## 🚀 The Turning Point: Going Digital with Avni

To overcome these operational hurdles, Hasiru Dala adopted **Avni**, an open-source platform tailored for fieldwork data collection and management. This move allowed them to transition from fragmented paper systems to a centralised, real-time, and error-resistant digital workflow.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Waste pickers are among the most marginalised urban workers in India, often facing systemic exclusion and deep-rooted social stigma. Providing them with identity, access to essential services, and pathways to formal employment not only transforms individual lives but also contributes to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as:

- **Decent Work and Economic Growth**
- **Reduced Inequalities**
- **Sustainable Cities and Communities**

Digital tools like Avni empower Hasiru Dala to deliver these interventions more effectively—by improving visibility, streamlining coordination, and ensuring that support reaches those who need it most.

The result is a model that enhances both **dignity** and **impact** for waste pickers.
