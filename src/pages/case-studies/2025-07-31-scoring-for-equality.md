Gender equality is not just a vision for Maitrayana‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey made up of sessions, skills, and stories.

From netball drills to digital safety, from career guidance to life skills education, Maitrayana‚Äôs sports-based programs equip adolescent girls across India‚Äôs cities with tools to lead empowered lives.

But when that journey spans multiple programs, hundreds of sessions, and thousands of girls in Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi, managing it on spreadsheets is not enough.

To ensure no girl gets left behind, Maitrayana uses the **Avni platform** to digitise how participants, sessions, and progress are tracked on the ground.

That‚Äôs where Avni steps in.

## A Structured Program Built on Batches, Sessions, and Outcomes

At the heart of Maitrayana‚Äôs model is a well-defined structure:

- Participants are enrolled into batches, each linked to a donor-funded programme.
- Each programme comprises multiple sessions focusing on:
  - ‚úÖ Life skills (e.g., leadership, communication, goal setting)
  - üèê Sports-based training (e.g., netball techniques, teamwork)
  - üë• Gender and social awareness
  - üß† Health and wellbeing

Every session is designed to follow a specific theme, ensuring consistency and measurable learning for each participant.

With Avni, Maitrayana tracks:

- **Individual-level details**: Participant profiles, batch enrolments, and session attendance  
- **Batch-level progress**: Completion status of sessions across batches  
- **Program-level analytics**: Total reach, attendance trends, and donor-linked metrics  

## A Visual Look at the Workflow

Here‚Äôs how Maitrayana‚Äôs process flows using Avni:

> The process begins with registering participants, followed by batch creation and program enrollment (e.g., EJP, Vriddhi, YPI Pragati). Field teams then use a Session Encounter Form to mark both the activity and attendance, with a dynamic list of participants per batch auto-populated.

## A Glimpse into the App

Below are a few screenshots from the Avni app that bring this workflow to life:

- **Batch Profile View**: Displays batch details along with a list of enrolled participants. It also links to all programs the batch is enrolled in, making it easy to view program-wise progress.  
- **Program Overview within a Batch**: Shows session history and enrollment details for each program the batch is a part of‚Äîbe it EJP, Vriddhi, or YPI Pragati.  
- **Session Attendance Form Summary**: Allows facilitators to quickly mark attendance and record activity details. The dynamic participant list ensures accuracy and saves time on the field.

These structured linkages‚Äîfrom Participant ‚Üí Batch ‚Üí Program ‚Üí Session Form‚Äîenable Maitrayana to monitor individual participation across multiple programs.

> Whether tracking a girl‚Äôs attendance in life skills sessions under YPI Pragati or her progress across digital, career readiness, and workplace rights sessions under the Economic Justice Program (EJP), this connected data flow allows for deeper insights into engagement and outcomes.

## Monitoring and Evaluation in Action

Maitrayana‚Äôs use of Avni doesn‚Äôt stop at field data capture‚Äîit‚Äôs actively used to drive **real-time monitoring and donor reporting**. For example:

- **Attendance Summary Reports**: Maitrayana tracks attendance trends across batches, sessions, and programs. A session-wise breakdown of attendance allows them to quickly identify drop-offs or engagement gaps.

- **Active Participant Dashboards**: Donor-wise participant engagement can be easily viewed using dashboards. This helps Maitrayana present granular data on how many girls are actively participating in each program funded by each donor.

These visual reports empower the team to:

- Monitor outreach and attendance in near real-time  
- Ensure batch-wise accountability linked to funders  
- Take quick corrective actions when needed  
- Share transparent updates with stakeholders  

With **Avni and Metabase combined**, Maitrayana has built a monitoring and evaluation framework that‚Äôs **scalable, transparent, and responsive** to the dynamic needs of a field-based gender equity program.

## A Replicable Model for Social Impact Organisations

Maitrayana‚Äôs approach offers a replicable blueprint for other organisations running **training, education, or empowerment programs**‚Äîespecially those with decentralised teams and session-based engagement.

Their use of Avni illustrates how the right digital tools can:

- üîç Bring structure to complex field operations  
- üìä Enable data-driven decisions and course corrections  
- ü§ù Build transparency and accountability with donors and stakeholders
